# Hexavalent

A Chromium downstream project

# Current project status

- Production builds to come soon.
- Project is still in early development stages.
- Current state of the project is still very far from our intentions in the far future.
- Keep it lowkey. Please.

# Aims

- Properly package and distribute Chromium as upstream intends.
- Use Clang/LLVM to compile Chromium as upstream intends.
- Use official builds only.
- Compile with modern security features that upstream provides.
- Build meaningful defenses of our own without compromising usability.
- Be easy to maintain, clean, quick and efficient.
- Fast updates â€” no more than 4 days lag time ideally.
- Leverage the Windows hypervisor platform on Windows.
